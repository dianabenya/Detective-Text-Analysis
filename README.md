# Detective-Text-Analysis

My aim was to figure out the perpetrator in a Sherlock novel without reading the novel itself. I was interested whether I can figure out a text analysing method with which I should not read a crime novel to know who was the perpetrator, but I link the novel into the below program and at the end it will show the perpetrator in the book.

First, I used a sentiment analysis. I supposed that the novel would contain a lots of negative sentiment words around the name of the perpetrator, so I analysed this theory.

Secondly, I set up a map connecting the names within the book as my assumption was that it will somehow show who could be the perpetrator. It would either show by having the most connection with other characters in the book or potentially the most connection with Sherlock in the novel
